20- starting to answer questions
40- more questions
60- more questions, letter, statement etc.

20-kind of finished application stuff - also started quickly thinking about the saxony application but oh buddy is that one daunting. Might be good just to do it but maybe not we'll see whatever either way works ok bye now.
