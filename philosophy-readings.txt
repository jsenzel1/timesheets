reading some baudrillard - ecstasy of communication and taking notes

20- reading - really great stuff and perfect for an essay I have in mind - taking a break now to go out and buy some sticky notes so I can mark things better
40-  finished the first chapter and wrote some notes about it - fantastic! incredible! what a great read just from the first chapter alone
