for baudrillard essay

20- reading "metamorphosis" chapter honestly didn't really get much out of this - interesting content but its not really related to the aspects of baudrillard I'm interested in right now
40- reading "seduction" chapter - really super good, lots of interesting stuff here, not sure exactly how related it is to the essay, but fascinating regaurdless
60- finishing up seduction chapter - super interesting 

20- forming some stream of thought ideas about messaging and baudrillard's seduction
40-writing some more of the small/modular/stream of thought components for the essay
60-writing some stuff on abbreviations/text based emojis and their difference in meaning

20 - getting a little distracted by other stuff - reading over some quotes and picking at a couple little things in writing but I think its time to switch gears to something else for the moment
