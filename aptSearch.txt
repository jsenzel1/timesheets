11/14 - going to try and start building a list/places to look at

20- getting together a shortlist of places to checkout from sublet.com (because I remembered that I already had a bunch saved there

40- messaged 4 sublets asking to check out apts. so I think right now I'll wait for a response and take it from there - signing off

Looked at one place that was interesting - still searching and my rental account got locked from a website so trying to deal with that
